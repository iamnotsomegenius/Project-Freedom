  - agent: "testing"
    message: "Detailed findings: 1) The API Health Check, Business Listings, and Authentication endpoints are working correctly. 2) The User Profiles, Investments, Offers, and Deals endpoints are failing because they're importing from the old 'auth' and 'database' modules instead of 'auth_supabase' and 'database_supabase'. 3) Unlike listings and auth, there doesn't appear to be a 'profiles_supabase.py' file, so the profiles.py file needs to be updated to use the Supabase modules. 4) The Payments and Files routers are correctly importing from 'auth_supabase' but weren't tested directly due to dependencies on external services."
